## Installation

zsh-sdkman is not bundled with ZSH, so you need to install it.

### [Antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen)

This plugin can be installed by adding `antigen bundle matthieusb/zsh-sdkman` to your `.zshrc` file. [Antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) will handle cloning the plugin for you automatically the next time you start `zsh`. You can also add the plugin to a running ZSH session with `antigen bundle matthieusb/zsh-sdkman` for testing before adding it to your `.zshrc`.

### [Zgen](https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen)

This plugin can be installed by adding `zgen load matthieusb/zsh-sdkman` to your `.zshrc` file in the same function you're doing your other `zgen load` calls in. [Zgen](https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen) will automatically clone the repositories for you when you do a `zgen save`.


### [Simple Oh-My-Zsh/Manual install](http://ohmyz.sh/)

Go to your *oh-my-zsh* folder and then in *custom/plugins* and clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/matthieusb/zsh-sdkman.git
```

And then, add to to your *.zshrc* plugin list like this:

```
plugins=(... zsh-sdkman)
```

**note:** cloning of zsh-sdkman requires the [Git Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com/) Git extension.

## Dependencies

There are several packages that you'll need for this plugin to work:
* sdkman of course
* `date`
* `grep` and `egrep`
* `sed`
* `awk`

## Usage

### First launch and completion update

On first launch, the script has to compute a few things in order to make the completion scripts work. It can take a while (I'd say five minutes tops) to be done so be patient.
This operation is repeated every 12 hours automatically.

**IMPORTANT**: if you do new installations on your sdkman candidate or just play around with new versions, uninstallations or updates, **DON'T FORGET** to refresh the completion script files with the following command:

```
sdk-refresh-completion-files
```

### Usage help

Sdkman can be used as usual:
